## Concepts Used:
    ● Java Swing
      Several swing components were used in the project, like JFrame, JPanel, JOptionPane,
      etc. To read more about these, please refer to the pdf sent after the minor projects. That
      much will be enough.
    
    ● Java AWT
      AWT Concepts used include all of the ActionListener functions. These basically get
      called automatically whenever a particular swing element is clicked on, and whatever we
      code inside will decide what happens if the user clicks on a particular button or a menu
      item and so on.
    
    ● MySQL
      This was the chosen Database used to keep all the records. Very basic commands were
      used, which you can find in various files throughout the project. We have created 4
      tables in total for Customers, Flights, Tickets, and Users. Just brush up on basic SQL
      commands, especially those that were used in the project.
    
    ● JDBC Driver
      A JDBC driver (Java Database Connectivity driver) is a small piece of software that
      allows JDBC to connect to different databases. Essentially, a JDBC driver makes it
      possible to do three things: Establish a connection with a data source. Send queries and
      update statements to the data source. Please understand what each of the four
      statements that I have told you about during the sessions does. Other than that also
      understand the functions of PreparedStatement, Connection variable and
      ExecuteQuery(), etc.
